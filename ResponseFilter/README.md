## Usage Example

### Code

```bash
    public async Task<IActionResult> Get()
    {
        var weatherForecast = new WeatherForecast()
        {
            Date = DateOnly.FromDateTime(DateTime.Now),
            TemperatureC = Random.Shared.Next(-20, 55),
            Summary = Summaries[Random.Shared.Next(Summaries.Length)]
        };

        var fields = new Fields
        {
            ResponseFields = "Date,TemperatureC"
        };

        var filteredResponse = Filter<WeatherForecast>.GetFilteredResponse(weatherForecast, fields);

        return Ok(filteredResponse);
    }
```
